			<h3>Who am I</h3>
			<p>My name is Aleix Linares and I am a programmer living in Spain. The purpose of this website is to show my creations to the world.</p>
			<h3>Software</h3>
			<p>Since I was 16 I knew that I wanted to learn to code and work as a programmer. To achieve this I got a Computer Science degree at the UPC of Barcelona. Until now I have worked in several small projects and videogames. Some of this projects are a runner game, a platformer game, an app to play Kakuros(a game similar to sudokus), a travel application, simulators...</p>
			<p>
			I have also worked for the UPC on the development of the Learning Dahsboard, a dashboard for monitoring the progress of software projects developed by student teams. You can find the paper submitted to the JENUI about this dashboard here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aenui.org/actas/pdf/JENUI_2022_051.pdf">JENUI paper</a></p>
			<h3>Videogames</h3>
			<p>
			My dream is to work as a videogame programmer and maybe some day make my own videogame. This is the reason most of the projects here are and will be videogames. However I still want to learn as much as possible from different fields before I start working with videogames.
